# 🚀 Automated Dockerized Deployment Script (`deploy.sh`)

## 📖 Overview
This project provides a **production-grade Bash script** (`deploy.sh`) that automates the complete setup, deployment, and configuration of a **Dockerized application** on a remote Linux server.  
It includes robust error handling, logging, validation, and idempotent behavior to ensure seamless re-deployment.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Automatically **clone a GitHub repository**
- Connect to a **remote server via SSH**
- Install **Docker**, **Docker Compose**, and **Nginx**
- Deploy the **Dockerized application**
- Configure **Nginx as a reverse proxy**
- Validate and log every step of the deployment

---

## 🧠 Key Features
✅ Collects user parameters interactively  
✅ Validates Git repository and branch  
✅ Checks for Dockerfile or docker-compose.yml  
✅ Handles remote SSH connection & package installation  
✅ Supports both `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` builds  
✅ Configures Nginx reverse proxy automatically  
✅ Includes full logging and error trapping  
✅ Can safely re-run without breaking existing setups
